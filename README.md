PROJECT OVERVIEW
Import Necessary Libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating visualizations.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization.   
sklearn: For machine learning tasks, including model selection, linear regression, and evaluation metrics.
Load the Dataset:

The fetch_california_housing function from sklearn.datasets is used to load the dataset.
The data is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and manipulation.
Data Exploration:

Basic statistics and visualizations are used to understand the data's distribution, relationships between features, and potential outliers.
Splitting the Data:

The data is divided into training and testing sets.
The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.   
Model Training:

A linear regression model is created and trained on the training data.
The model learns the relationship between features (like number of rooms, population density) and the target variable (median house price).
Model Evaluation:

The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing data.
The predictions are compared to the actual values using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
